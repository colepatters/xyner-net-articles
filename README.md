# xyner-net-articles

## Hello, World!

Hi there! this is the GitHub repository where these articles will live and be updated. My first plan was to use Google Cloud, but I'm already familiar with version control with Git, so here we are.

## Caveats

While you will be able to read these articles using GitHub's Markdown reader, I cannot guarantee it will be the best experience. Some elements will only be functional or visible on my site [xyner.net](https://xyner.net/), due to the way I have everything set up.

## What's with the license?

While I believe that everyone has the right to learn, I don't believe it should come with opportunities for bad actors to copy content without attribution. I whole-heartedly want you to share these articles with others!! All I ask is that you give some sort of attribution if you use or remix my content. Happy reading!
